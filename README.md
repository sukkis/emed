# emed

`emed` is a tiny terminal-based editor project I’m building to learn Rust and terminal UI programming (via `crossterm`). It’s a learning playground first, so expect rough edges and frequent changes.

## Status

Early prototype / work in progress. Not useful (yet).

## Goals

- Learn Rust by building something interactive
- Keep the codebase small and understandable

## Build & run

Prerequisites: a recent Rust toolchain.

## Controls

- `q` — quit
- `Ctrl+x` then `Ctrl+c` — quit (Emacs-style)

## License
